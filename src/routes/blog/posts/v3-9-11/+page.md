Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.9.11** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/). If you'd like to support the project, consider purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## Changes

### Reduced frequency of the review prompt

The review prompt in the Store version of Files will now appear only once per user, and only after 30 sessions. Additionally, the prompt no longer blocks user input and is designed to be less disruptive.

## Fixes

### Grouping

- Fixed an issue where the group header text was misaligned.  

## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how we improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! ðŸ˜Š
