Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.9.13** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/). If you'd like to support the project, consider purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2).

## Changes

### Context menu customization

We added support for turning off the 'Open in Terminal' option in the right click context menu. This setting can be accessed from the [general](/docs/customize-settings/general) settings page.

## Fixes

### Keyboard shortcuts

- Fixed issue where the delete key wouldn't work after removing an item from the selection.
- Fixed issue preventing file selection via keyboard.

### About page

- Fixed issue where the Windows version was copied incorrectly.

## Conclusion
